					<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
					<p>We want a diverse classroom. If you are a student who is not from the Computer Science department, Management Science &amp; Engineering department, or Symbolic Systems program, there may be some flexibility in these prerequisites. Please speak to the instructor or post on Piazza.</p>

					<p>CS 147 or equivalent experience in design thinking is the first prerequisite for this course. This class moves quickly and assumes that you already have learned the basics of the design process and have executed a significant design project previously. This class focuses deeply on subsets of the design process. If you have never taken a design or HCI course, you could probably understand the content but you would not be well prepared to integrate it into the broader process.</p>

					<p>CS106B or equivalent programming experience is the second prerequisite for this course. The prerequisite exists because all students will need some fluency in building interactive systems to complete the project. Every student must make a significant contribution to their team's implementation; students who are unable to do so should not take the class. That said, some may do more of the programming work, and others more of the user testing work. Project teams will benefit from being multidisciplinary. Students with less programming experience (and e.g., more design experience) should consider partnering with students who with complementary strengths.</p>
				</div>

				<div id='laptop' class='sidenav-anchor'>
					<h3>Bring a sketchbook, pen and laptop</h3>
						<p>Buy a sketchbook and pen as described in <a href="projects/p1.html">Project 1</a>, and bring it with you to all class meetings. Use it liberally, in and out of class. If you have a digital tablet with stylus and can show us that you use it regularly for notetaking and freeform capture, that would be fine as well.</p>
						<p>Here are some local Art Supplies stores where you can snag those sketchbooks:</p>
					    	<ul>
                                <li>University Art<p>2550 El Camino Real, Redwood City, CA 94061<p></li>
                                <li>Accent Art<p>392 California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94306</p></li>
					    	</ul>
						<p>
						Bring a laptop to class. This is a course requirement because of the hands-on work we'll do. If the laptop's battery won't last the whole class, arrive early to get a set near a plug. (And you may want to bring an extension cord.) Please restrict your laptop use to class-relevant activities, like doing the exercises or taking notes. No Facebook, email, etc. Why? It distracts other students, not just you.

				<div id="studio" class="sidenav-anchor">
					<h3>Studio</h3>
					<p>This class is titled HCI Design Studio because its goal is to give you an advanced design studio experience. Studio is a central component of class: each studio is headed by an industry professional with years of experience in design and user experience. Thank you to the Computer Science department for financial support for studio instructors.</p>

					<p>Each studio instructor has selected a topic. Choosing a studio thus means choosing a topic for many projects in this course. Choosing a studio also means picking out a potential mentor. Weigh and integrate the two to make your choice!</p>

					<p>Studios will provide you an opportunity to meet in smaller groups in order to discuss and reflect on weekly assignments and project progress. They will focus on interactive critique sessions, as well as specific activities intended to supplement and expand on ideas from lectures.</p>

					<p>Students must <a href="http://hci.st/247studio">sign up</a> for their studio by 11:59pm on the Wednesday of the first week of class.</p>

					<h4>Studio Themes</h4>
                    <div id="video-embed"></div>
					<!--
					<h5>Collaboration (Sanjay)</h5>
					<p>This quarter, you will be designing applications designed for mobile phones - communication devices that we carry around with us everywhere we go. In this studio, we'll focus primarily on projects designed to influence and transform the ways that people interact with each other or their larger community. Your application might focus on connecting individuals or facilitating interaction across larger communities or even cities. How might your application address issues of privacy and relevance? Will your application target casual, social activities, or serious, professional use cases? Will your users communicate synchronously or over long time intervals?</p>
					<h5>Change (Julie)</h5>
					<p>Change is hard. Sometimes because we lack information, and other times because our routines or habits are hard to shake. Can technology help people and communities change their behavior to meet their goals? New electronic devices (computers, phones, tablets...) can help by providing information, reminding us, and connecting us with others. Want to keep a commitment to running more? Go with a friend. Change might mean exercising more, eating healthier, helping make a more sustainable planet, or participating in local government. It might even start with something as simple as remembering to see the world from a new perspective.</p>
					<h5>Digital Self (Jon)</h5>
					<p>Mobile devices are excellent tools for tracking our daily activities and interactions with others. But what kind of data is appropriate to gather? What meaning should we assign it? And how can we use it to set goals, make changes, and reflect on our place in the world? In the digital self studio, we will seek out answers to these questions in an effort to improve individual well-being (think health, fitness, time management, and interpersonal relationships).</p>
					<h5>Glance (Graham)</h5>
					<p>We are surrounded by information -- some might even call it overload -- and we don't have the time to sift through all of it. But we also compulsively check email, Twitter, Facebook, and the news -- just in case there's something new there. Instead of doing the filtering and finding ourselves, why not let our mobile devices do it for us? How might mobile technology show us the essential pieces at a glance, we so we can quickly navigate through the noise to get to what we really want? How can a mobile screen summarize information and present just the most relevant parts? Consider the sphere of information that interest you (news, learning, personal quantification, etc.) and think about how microinteractions with this information can shape and be shaped by our lives.</p>
					<h5>Time (Gilbert)</h5>
					<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> encourages us to structure our working time more efficiently. Toys like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamogotchi">Tamagotchi</a> demand our periodic attention and time. We install sofware to tell us we've been spending too much time on Facebook. We build <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Now_Clock">clocks to track the progression of epochs</a>. In this studio, we'll spend our time exploring how to design around time (seconds, minutes, months, or years). Will your app help users gain control of their time, or (perhaps, more nefariously) help users control others' time? Will it be used constantly or once in a blue moon? Can it enhance people's perception of time? Or maybe help them lose track of time altogether.</p>
					<h5>Language (Omosola)</h5>
					<p>Language shapes our conversations, limits who we can and cannot interact with, restricts us or frees us to express certain emotions. In this studio, we will explore ways in which technology can interact with human language, tackling questions such as: How can technology facilitate communication between global teams, moving us beyond linguistic or cultural barriers? How can technology facilitate learning and using new languages? How do technological constraints shape our use of language (e.g. How have short forms of communication, like SMS or Twitter, changed the way we use language?)</p>
					<h5>Style (Jingshu)</h5>
					<em>"Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn."</em>
					<p>Our style -- expressed through fashion to art, architecture, and everyday life -- describes us and defines the way we live. It's a matter of both internal self-image and external projection. Technology is changing the way we discover, create, and share style. Consider startups in this area like <a href="http://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a>, <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/">Polyvore</a>, and <a href="http://www.quirky.com/">Quirky</a>. Many of these apps were not specifically designed for mobile phones, leaving a lot of room to reimagine and innovate by considering how we could make full use of mobile devices. How might we capture instant inspiration from our surroundings? How might your users work together to define new trends? What's the future of shopping, fashion shows, music festivals, and museums? It's your call - turn on your swag and design cool apps!</p>
					<h5>Health (Will)</h5>
					<p>Mobile phones and smart devices have great potential to improve the ways people monitor, preserve, and improve their health. Phones have been used to assist and inform doctors, track and support compliance with treatments, and passively or actively gather patient information. Successfully designing for health requires tackling challenges around providing usable interfaces and navigating privacy concerns. Beyond these challenges lie real opportunitise to improve the lives of people in meaningful ways.</p>
                    <h5>Learning (Kingston)</h5>
                    <p>Learning is an integral part of becoming who we are.  Whether it be American history or how to beat Candy Crush, we are constantly learning new skills and knowledge.  In this section, we focus on what it means to learn and different interfaces with which we can encourage learning (both formal and informal).  Already, we have seen enormous strides in how we learn from online education to iPad apps that a 3-year-old can use.  How else might technology impact the way we learn?</p>
					<h5>Collaboration (Heidi)</h5>
					<p>In academic, professional, and other environments, collaboration is key. When we work together towards a shared goal, we can be more creative, move faster, and learn from each other. In this studio, we'll focus on creating solutions to help people improve the way they collaborate. How can we help people find the best collaboration partners? How can we facilitate meaningful collaboration over the lifecycle of a project? How can we improve communication within a team (tackle scheduling problems, improve coordination for non-colocated groups, etc.)? How can we help teams recognize each member's strengths and partition tasks effectively?</p>
					<h5>Emotion (Stephen)</h5>
					<p>Technology now touches almost every aspect of human experience, one of the most central of which is emotion. Through both hardware and software, designers now have the opportunity to affect users’ emotions in a number of ways. We might design software that helps people to track and reflect on their own emotions or we might design applications that help people form more intimate relationships. Well-designed software and hardware can even encourage users to form emotional connections to the technology itself. In this studio, we will explore projects which design for emotional connections with technology.</p>

					<h3>Assignments and Grading</h3>

					<div id="deliverables" class="sidenav-anchor">
						<h4>Deliverables</h4>
						<p>The class consists of four projects (P1&ndash;P4) that grow in ambition as the quarter progresses. Projects will have intermediate deadlines before each week's studio. In cases where a holiday means there is no studio, the assignment will be due on the next day of classes. You will share progress and deliverables in studio each week. The final project culminates in a presentation and poster at the end of the quarter in front of invited design jurors.</p>

						<p>You will submit your work using our server. Details TBA. Late assignments will not be accepted. There are two reasons that assignments need to be submitted on time. First, to be able to provide you with rapid feedback about your work, the teaching staff begins looking at assignments before studio each week. Second, you'll present your work in studio every week, and you need to be prepared to participate.</p>

						<p>There are rubrics beneath each assignment that explain how you and the staff will grade your submission. Different columns represent different scores.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="breakdown" class="sidenav-anchor">
						<h4>Grade breakdown</h4>
            			<p>The course grade is broken down as:</p>
						<ul>
              				<li>Projects: 85%
              					<ul>
              						<li>P1: 10%</li>
              						<li>P2: 20%</li>
              						<li>P3: 20%</li>
              						<li>P4: 35%</li>
              					</ul>
              				</li>
							<li>One quiz: 5%</li>
							<li>Participation: 10% (6% for studio participation, 4% for lecture and team participation)</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Credit</h4>
						<p>Letter grade only: the "credit/no credit" option is not available. We have learned through hard experience that teams that are composed of students on different grading outcomes tend to end up in flames.</p>

						<h4>Regrades</h4>
						<p>It is very important to us that all assignments are properly graded. The teaching staff works extremely hard to grade fairly and to turn around assignments quickly. We know what you work hard, and we respect that. Occasionally, mistakes happen, and it's important to us to correct them. If you believe there is an error in your assignment or exam grading, please submit an explanation in writing to your studio TA within 7 days of receiving the grade. We will regrade the entire assignment to ensure quality. No regrade requests will be accepted orally, and no regrade requests will be accepted more than four days after receipt of the assignment. Regrade requests must be respectful; we will not consider any regrade requests containing disrespectful language.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="attendance" class="sidenav-anchor">
						<h3>Attendance</h3>
						<p>Design is a contact sport. Attendance is required for both lecture and studio. Trust us, this makes the class much better.</p>

						<p>Lecture is not a traditional stand-and-teach lecture. It is interactive, and will involve a number of activities that can't be caught up later. We expect you to be active at the class scale and also locally at your tables. Your participation grade in the class will reflect this.</p>

						<p>Studio is where the action is. Sharing your work and discussing designs with others is an important part of your design education. Therefore, studio attendance is mandatory. To receive credit for attendance, you must arrive on time. You are allowed <strong>two excused</strong> absences for the quarter without penalty; thereafter you will receive zero credit for the missed studio. To receive an excused absence, you must ask your studio instructor <strong>in advance</strong>, and receive an acknowledgment from the studio instructor.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Excusable absences include family emergencies, job interviews, and presenting at a conference. It does not include wanting to leave early for long weekend or vacation.</li>
							<li>Attending another class during lecture or studio is not an excusable absence.</li>
							<li>Varsity athletes who would like to miss more than two studios to participate in athletic competitions must make any request before the end of the first week of class. No exceptions will be granted after the study list deadline.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div id="harassment-policy" class="sidenav-anchor">
						<h3>Encouraging An Open Design Environment</h3>
						<p>The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the class’s goals. These aims require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity.</p>

                        <p>It's possible for even well-intended students to accidentally alienate your peers. Your designs can make unwelcome assumptions that don't fit some minority lives, and it's also possible for your critiques and conversations to constitute what's called <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/volunteer_resources/officers_manual/anti-harassment-policy">harassment</a>. Harassment means unwelcome or even hostile behavior, including speech, that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person's participation or opportunity for participation. That behavior will shut the person down in class or studio, and that is simply not fair and not something we want in an open design environment. Harassment can involve nationality, age, color, creed, disability, gender, sexual orientation or any other protected status. It also extends to unwelcome sexual advances. A response that the participant was “just joking,” or “teasing,” or being “playful,” is not acceptable. If you have witnessed or experienced any harassment, please let an instructor know privately and promptly.</p>

						<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4">
		  						<strong>What's the amount of time involved in the class?</strong>
		  					</div>
		  					<div class="col-md-8">
		  						<p>There's a healthy amount of work involved. As with any design experience, you get out what you put in. Great projects explore broadly and dive deep, and needfinding, design, implementation and evaluation take time to do well. Projects will escalate in terms of ambition throughout the quarter. Expect that the final project will be a major effort in the last few weeks of class.</p>
		  					</div>
		  				</div>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4">
		  						<strong>The class uses HTML and Javascript. Can our group use iOS programming?</strong>
		  					</div>
		  					<div class="col-md-8">
		  						<p>We recommend against it. We choose technologies that give you a lot of interaction power for very little upfront cost. Others can take many hours to get running. Most group problems arise when one person strongarms their teammates into using another technology. Late in the quarter, it turns out that only one person can really do the work, and that causes all the problems you can imagine. If you use the technology stack we teach, we will teach you key techniques and the TAs will help you if you get stuck. With other technologies, you're off-piste: we can't save you, and it can get awfully cold when the sun goes down. With that information, the choice is yours.</p>

							<div class="col-md-4">
		  						<strong>Do I have to go to studios?</strong>
		  					</div>
		  					<div class="col-md-8">
		  						<p>Yes. Attendance at studios is mandatory.</p>
		  					</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4">
		  						<strong>Can I have an extension? I have a lot of work in other classes, I'll be out of town, I'm generally overwhelmed...</strong>
		  					</div>
		  					<div class="col-md-8">
		  						<p>No. It's not because we're callous — we've all been in your shoes. Two reasons: 1) because sharing work in studio is integral to the class, there's no practical way to offer extensions. 2) Psychology teaches us that people consistently believe they'll have more time in the future than in the present -- and that it's a fallacy. When you pick classes for the quarter, make sure not to overcommit. In our experience, you'll learn more and have a better resume by doing a great job in a smaller of classes, rather than trying to take as many units as humanly possible and doing a mediocre job with all of it.</p>

		  						<strong>Are there any midterms or finals?</strong>
		  					</div>
		  					<div class="col-md-8">
		  						<p>There will be one midterm that will probe your understanding of the readings and the lecture concepts. Keep in mind, however, that the projects are worth far more to the course.

		  						<strong>When do we form groups?</strong>
		  					</div>
		  					<div class="col-md-8">
		  						<p>You will form groups within the studio as each new group project begins. We will strongly encourage you to form new groups for each new group project. All groups must be of size 3. During team formation make sure to ask your potential teammates 2 questions. 1) When are you available to meet? 2) What level of performance to you intend to achieve? This will help you find like-minded teammates.</p>

		  						<p>In classes as in life, some team problems are inevitable. As soon as you encounter subpar performance by a teammate: talk to them and accurately record their performance in your team assessment. There are many benefits to speaking up early. First, you've made your expectations clear so your teammate can adjust their performance. Second, it's on record in case things get worse later. Past performance is the best predictor of future performance, and transparency is the best management tool. If you speak up early, we can help. If you wait until late in the quarter to speak up, you share responsibility for the problem &mdash; and there's little we can do.</p>

                  				<p>If you have a serious problem with your teammate(s), email them with your concerns, cc'ing your TA, studio instructor, or professor, requesting that the team attend office hours to discuss the issue. If this discussion doesn't ameliorate the issue, you may notify your teammate(s) via email (cc'ding the instructor) of your intention to quit/fire them unless performance improves. Finally, if performance doesn't improve, you may email your teammate(s) (cc'ing the instructor) with your resignation/firing. A teammate who quits or is fired is responsible for future assignments on their own. <a href=http://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/hci/other_ressources/OakleyHitchhikers2004.pdf>This short essay by Oakley et al.</a> provides great advice on diagnosing 'hitchhikers' and dealing with them effectively.</p>

                <strong> Guidelines on using Wizard of Oz in the final project</strong>
              </div>

              <div class='col-md-8'>
                <p>The reason we implement things is to learn about how to better design the interaction, not to do busy work. By making your project more realistic, you will uncover design issues that may not be apparent with Wizard of Oz alone. Your final project will be evaluated on the design of the interactions, and you are certain to produce a better interaction if it is more realistic.
                Good heuristics to decide what to implement:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>If you can implement it, do it</li>
                  <li>You should be focusing on the interaction design. If implementing it will take an inordinate amount of time, you should Wizard of Oz it in the most realistic way</li>
                  <li>If it would be impossible for anyone to implement it, your design is wrong</li>
                </ol>

                <p>To make this more concrete, consider the following two examples:
                  You are building a navigation application for pedestrians. This application will leverage GPS information to support wayfinding. In this instance it would be highly recommended that you implement GPS functionality for real, since it is central to the application.
                  You are building a social photo sharing application. Amongst a host of other features, you’d like this application to geotag photos if a GPS location is available. In this case, it may be appropriate to Wizard of Oz the GPS functionality, since it is not central to the application.
                  While implementing GPS functionality would take the same amount of effort in both cases, there is a much larger potential payoff for implementing it in the first case because it impacts a much larger portion of the interaction design.</p>

						<strong>I would like to take another class that overlaps this class. What should I know?</strong>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>Class attendance is required because the in-class material and exercises connect the principles taught through lecture to the design project work. In short: CS 247 is an attendance-required course.</p>
					</div>

  						<strong>A personal issue (health, family event, other commitment) will take me away from class. What should I do?</strong>
  					</div>
  					<div class="col-md-8">
  						<p>Most importantly, let your studio instructor, TA and your team know ASAP. The sooner we hear from you, the more we can help. If you give your team a heads-up quickly, they're sure to be empathetic. If you just disappear for a few weeks, they'll be unlikely to want you back. Even if you have a good reason, no one likes being left out in the cold.</p>

						<p>Fairness requires us to grade on performance, not desire. Think about if this issue came up when you were about to take the SAT &mdash; or if it came up in a job. Realistically, if you're away for more than a week, you have two choices: you can push forward and accept lower performance, or you can drop the class and retake it when you have more time. We recommend the second option whenever possible.</p>

  						<p>Design praxis means being open to currently unseen alternatives. If you have an idea for a project at the beginning of the class, give yourself the benefit of the doubt and set it aside. Explore around its edges. Trying to bend our rules to make your previous idea fit typically results in poor projects — not because your idea is bad, but that its current problems are not a good match for a design thinking course. Take it to an entrepreneurship class. At the end of the class, you will have acquired skills to execute your idea far more competently than you would right now.</p>

		  						<strong>I have a question that's not answered here. How do I contact the teaching staff?</strong>
		  					</div>
		  					<div class="col-md-8">
		  						<p>If you have a question, post it to the class Piazza forum — don't send email. This includes <strong>all</strong> questions about assignment clarifications and class requirements. The reason: you may think you're the only one with this question. With over one hundred students, someone else is bound to be interested. Answering all questions in a public place means that every student has access to the same information. It's both efficient and fair.</p>

								<p>If you missed class (or will miss class) and would like to find out what's covered, review the syllabus materials then ask a fellow student to fill you in. Do not send email -- it's your responsibility.</p>

								<p>Also, you're welcome to come to office hours and ask any question you want. You can ask questions about classes, internships, design, graduate school, jobs, or simply come to say hi, listen to other students questions, or share your background and interests. Office hours are for you, and Michael and the teaching staff really value your presence and questions.</p>

								<p>With so many students, we unfortunately cannot accommodate requests to meet outside of office hours. We trust that if your question is important, you can find a way to make the time to come to office hours.</p>
