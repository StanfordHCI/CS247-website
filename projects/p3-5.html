    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <p>In Part V, we put our functional prototype in front of living, breathing users in order to focus our iteration. The last possible day for getting credit for this milestone, or any of Parts I-V, is the final studio day of the quarter.</p>

                    <p>Below is the staff's recommended timeline for Project 3. These dates are the dates by which we recommend completing each milestone: keep in mind that <b>it may take several iterations of feedback on submissions before you and your team are ready to declare a milestone complete</b>. So aim to submit your first version of each milestone at least one studio day before the deadline you want to hit.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Oct. 19 (week 5): P3.I — form team, identify area of interest, and perform needfiding observation</li>
                        <li>Oct. 26 (week 6): P3.II — needfinding interpretation, brainstorming</li>
                        <li>November 2 (week 7): P3.III — prototyping and user feedback</li>
                        <li>November 19 (week 9): P3.IV — working implementation</li>
                        <li>November 30 (week 10): P3.V — user study results and redesign plan</li>
                        <li>December 4 (week 10): P3.VI — final presentation, <b>hard deadline</b></li>
                        <li>December 7 (finals) @ 12:15pm: Final submission, <b>hard deadline</b></li>

                    <h2>User feedback</h2>
                    <p>Find representative users for your design and bring them in for a user feedback session. This should involve at least five different users. (If the nature of your design means that your user group is extremely difficult to connect with, coordinate with your studio staff to decide on a realistic goal.)</p>

                    <p>For each user, set the stage and make sure they understand that you are testing the prototype, not them. Lay out tasks or goals that they are trying to achieve, and let them interact with your prototype. Make sure one of your team members is taking notes and recording any relevant media (e.g., photos, video). Another team member should guide the process. Encourage the user to follow a think-aloud protocol — you likely learned this technique in CS 147. Try your absolute hardest not to intervene. Watching helplessly as someone struggles to use your interface is one of the hardest, but most valuable, things you can do.</p>

                    <p>Afterwards, it's time to synthesize. Convert your observations into sticky notes and start clustering them on a whiteboard. Identify themes, re-cluster, and discuss until your main reflections have settled.</p>

                    <p>Write up a brief report detailing your method, results, and reflections.</p>
                </div>                

                <div id="iterate" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Iterate</h2>
                    <p>Based on your feedback from your users and in your studio, iterate on your prototype. Sketch the redesigned elements that your group has decided to pursue as a result of the user study. You'll be reimplementing these before the final presentation. This is your last chance to pull out the stops!</p>

                    <h2>Submit</h2>
                    <p>Pull everything together into your submission folder labeled "P3-5". This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Raw observations and sketches about your user study.</li>

                    </ul>
