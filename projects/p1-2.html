    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p>The goal of Part II is to abandon a common error that new designers make: focusing on raw, surface-level description in needfinding. When students graduate from CS 147, typically their needfinding output is still extremely surface-level (e.g., "The space was loud, so we should find ways to make it quieter." Instead, think along the lines of "How might we make the space calming? Like a spa?") This time, the expectations are higher. We'll aim to turn those observations into focused needs.</p>

                    <h2>Assignment</h2>
                    <p>Start by reflecting on any feedback you got in class on Part I. Do you need to go do more observations? More interviews? Capture it in your sketchbook. Make sure that you feel like you've reached a reasonable saturation point in your understanding.</p>

                    <p>After you're done, synthesize your raw observations into <i>interpretations</i>. Make sure you call out <i>needs</i>. Remember, needs are <i>verbs</i> (activities or desires that your user could use some help). They are not nouns (solutions). If you need a reminder of these terms and methods, check this week's lecture and reading, or look at the <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BootcampBootleg2010v2SLIM.pdf">d.school Bootcamp Bootleg</a>.

                    <p>The method we recommend: put your observations on stickies and organize, reorganize, and reorganize them. Keep discussioning and synthesizing what you've found - what do people say? what did they do? how did they think? what did they feel? Notice patterns and contradictions (things that people say are fine but are clearly too cumbersome) among these to draw out important insights. Set aside a large block of time to do this. It cannot be rushed. It often takes longer than the interviews themselves because you are working to pull out all the nuggets.</p>

                    <p>Your report should contain a combination of text, images, sketches, and potentially other media. Work to produce a number of <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/HMW-METHODCARD.pdf">How Might We...?" questions</a> (see also this week's lecture) that can inspire specific brainstorms. Do not submit a raw dump of materials; rather, organize a subset of your most salient, insightful or inspiring observations and interpretations. In practice, having good observations and insights is just half the bill. Being able to communicate them effectively in an emotionally appealing and data-driven manner is another very important aspect of being a designer or a UX researcher.</p>

                    <p>In particular, back up each interpretation and How Might We question with an observation, a quote or a picture.</p>
