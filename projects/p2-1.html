    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                        <h4 style="color: #888888">Part I: Redesign</h4>

                        <p class="lead">P2 is our opportunity to dive into design for the web. This project focuses on the visual, the aesthetic and the interactive aspects of design. It does so first through mocks, then through code.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div id="goals" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p>The goal of Part I: exercise your visual design skills. Now that you are comfortable communicating your ideas in visual form, we can work to design experiences that are visually and interactively engaging. In Part I, you will generate several concepts and mocks. We'll work together to critique and improve them.</p>

                    <p>Coming up, in Part II you'll implement one of the designs in HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="assignment" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Visual design and layout</h2>
                    <p>There will be two design exercises with P2 Part I. The first one is brief, and the second one is substantial. First, we seek a redesign of the stanford.edu mobile homepage:</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <img class="img img-responsive col-md-4" src="../images/p2-stanford.jpg" />
                    </div>

                    <p>In particular, please only design what is above the fold (i.e. visible without scrolling the page). You'll need to decide what is important enough to be above the fold. Consider what information that visitors to the Stanford homepage seek, especially those who are likely visiting from their phones.</p>

                <div id="sketchstanford" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Sketch five thumbnails</h4>
                    <p>We're looking for you to generate five different concept thumbnails focusing on the layout of the page. Each sketch should be about a quarter-page if you're using an 8.5"x11" sketchbook. They're intentionally postcard-sized so that you focus on the overall layout rather than detail. Try different grid structures and leaving negative (white) space in places. Aim for variety &mdash; diversity in your sketches will make it easier to find the design that you like best. Feel free to include color in your sketches if it would help convey your idea, but using grayscale is great too.</p>

                    <p>As you're creating concepts, keep in mind our class discussion and lecture on layout hierarchy and grids.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="mockstanford" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Create one mock</h4>
                    <p>Mocks need to be detailed and make a lot of <b>low-level visual design and interaction design decisions</b>. This is where the details of your visual and interaction design need to fall into place. Choose your favorite thumbnail and create a pixel-perfect mock.</p>

                    <p>Coming soon: a Sketch file from the course staff that recreates the current page design, which you can explore to get you started. (Thanks, Ishita!)</p>

                    <p>If you can get your hands on a Mac, we strongly recommend the trial version of <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch for OS X</a>. (You can also install it on the cluster computers.) Its <a href="http://www.sketchappsources.com/">large library of templates</a> can give you tons of premade elements (e.g., <a href="http://bootstrapuikit.com/">Twitter Bootstrap UI elements</a>) so you don't need to reinvent everything from scratch. An alternative is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a> or Photoshop, available on Stanford cluster machines. Many of the UI template libraries work with these tools as well. However, they have high learning curves. If you are truly stuck, tools such as Keynote or Powerpoint can work, but be aware that it can be difficult to use them to produce designs that look like they would be realistic web sites rather than slideware.</p>

                    <p>Work together with your team to critique and refine your mock.</p>

                <div id="assignment" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Studio design prompt</h2>
                    <p>The second exercise shifts focus from a focused static design to a broader design focused around your studio's theme, and one where you will likely need to think about visual design, interaction design, and information hierarchy all in tandem.</p>

                    <p>The exact prompt differs by studio. They will appear here as each studio instructor prepares them.</p>
                    

                <div id="define" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Define your user</h4>
                    <p>First, reflect for a moment on who the user is for your prompt. Who will come to this application, and for what reason? What content will they be looking for? You'll need to make some hard decisions about what is important, and critically, what can be removed or compressed.</p>

                    <p>Next, think about what kind of visual and interactive identity this application should be conveying. Young and edgy? Global and inclusive? Wicked smart but still fun-loving? </p>

                    <p>Write up a brief paragraph or two summarizing your reflections on who your users are, and what content they're going to be looking for.</p>
                </div>

                    <h4>Find examples</h4>
                    <p>Given your goals from above, go find other web sites and applications that communicate the same idea. You're welcome to find as many as you'd like, but screenshot and share at least four. Now it's time for a little critique. For each item, annotate it with one "I Like..." and one "I Wish..." statement. For example, "I like this guide's use of San Francisco iconography. It really makes the guide feel local.", and "I wish that the art deco theme weren't so overwrought." Do not focus on low-level usability problems &mdash; critique the design's high-level decisions.</p>

                <div id="moodboard" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Create a mood board</h4>
                    <p>Now, it's time to design on a design concept and collect a mood board. Remember, a mood board must have a mood of some sort; it can't be just a collection of stuff you like. Example themes might be 1) watercolor art, 2) UNIX terminal, or 3) dominant use of negative space. Refer to lecture for more detail.</p>

                    <p>To create the mood board, collect concepts, photos, color swatches, illustrations, shapes, and anything else that conveys the identity you want to get across. Collect the ones you like into a page that is at least 8.5"x11". Powerpoint and Keynote should be plenty powerful for this purpose, but pick any digital layout tool you like.</p>

                    <p>There are two common errors that previous CS 247 students have made when creating mood boards. The first error is a mood board that has no clear concept behind it. A mood board must be more targeted than full web pages: it must be small clippings, headlines, images, and other very specific media that evoke your concept. The second error is that they don't communicate a single mood or concept. If you're going for a punk aesthetic, find pieces of media that feel punk!</p>

                    <h4>Sketch ten thumbnails</h4>
                    <p>It's time to start brainstorming concepts for your site. Spend some time with your sketchbook and your mood board, and sketch out different approaches to the design of your site. We're looking for you to generate ten different concept thumbnails focusing on the layout of the page. Try different grid structures and leaving negative (white) space in places. Aim for variety &mdash; diversity in your sketches will make it easier to find the design that you like best.

                    <h4>Pixel-perfect mocks</h4>
                    <p>Having explored the options, you are ready to refine your top three ideas into three pixel-perfect mocks. We'll talk later in the class about why going for breadth with three different ideas is a good idea, but for now suffice it to say that an experienced designer would ever walk into a meeting with only one concept. Your mocks should capture exactly what the application will look like when you implement the application using web technology. We will be critiquing the mocks in studio, so make sure they represent your design well.</p>

                    <p>However, apart from the points, this assignment will also feed into Part II. So, the course staff will separately give you in-class feedback on the quality of your submission on a check-minus, check, check-plus scale. If you get a check-minus, strongly consider editing Part I before moving on to Part II, since your foundation is shaky. A check is fine but should do some tweaking, and the rare check-plus means that you've exceeded our expectations.</p>
