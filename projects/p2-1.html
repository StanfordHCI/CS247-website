    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Hail, Stanford, Hail</h2>
                    <p>There will be two design exercises with P2 Part I. This first one is brief, and the second one is substantial. First, we seek a redesign of the stanford.edu mobile homepage:</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <img class="img img-responsive col-md-4" src="../images/p2-stanford.jpg" />
                    </div>

                    <p>In particular, please only design what is above the fold (i.e. visible without scrolling the page). You'll need to decide what is important enough to be above the fold. Consider what information that visitors to the Stanford homepage seek, especially those who are likely visiting from their phones.</p>

                <div id="sketchstanford" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Sketch five thumbnails</h4>
                    <p>We're looking for you to generate five different concept thumbnails focusing on the layout of the page. Each sketch should be about a quarter-page if you're using an 8.5"x11" sketchbook. They're intentionally postcard-sized so that you focus on the overall layout rather than detail. Try different grid structures and leaving negative (white) space in places. Aim for variety &mdash; diversity in your sketches will make it easier to find the design that you like best. Feel free to include color in your sketches if it would help convey your idea, but using grayscale is great too.</p>

                    <p>As you're creating concepts, keep in mind our class discussion and lecture on layout hierarchy and grids.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="mockstanford" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Create one mock</h4>
                    <p>Mocks need to be detailed and make a lot of <b>low-level visual design and interaction design decisions</b>. This is where the details of your visual and interaction design need to fall into place. Choose your favorite thumbnail and create a pixel-perfect mock.</p>

                    <p>Coming soon: a Sketch file from the course staff that recreates the current page design, which you can explore to get you started. (Thanks, Ishita!)</p>

                    <p>If you can get your hands on a Mac, we strongly recommend the trial version of <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch for OS X</a>. (You can also install it on the cluster computers.) Its <a href="http://www.sketchappsources.com/">large library of templates</a> can give you tons of premade elements (e.g., <a href="http://bootstrapuikit.com/">Twitter Bootstrap UI elements</a>) so you don't need to reinvent everything from scratch. An alternative is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a> or Photoshop, available on Stanford cluster machines. Many of the UI template libraries work with these tools as well. However, they have high learning curves. If you are truly stuck, tools such as Keynote or Powerpoint can work, but be aware that it can be difficult to use them to produce designs that look like they would be realistic web sites rather than slideware.</p>

                    <p>Work together with your team to critique and refine your mock.</p>

                <div id="assignment" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Studio design prompts</h2>
                    <p>Your studios each have themed prompts that draw together interaction design, information hierarchy, and visual design. The exact prompt differs by studio. They will appear here as each studio instructor prepares them.</p>
                    

                <div id="define" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Define your user</h2>
                    <p>First, reflect for a moment on who the user is for your prompt. Who will come to this application, and for what reason? What content will they be looking for? You'll need to make some hard decisions about what is important, and critically, what can be removed or compressed.</p>

                    <p>Use these insights to guide your interaction decisions for the rest of the assignment. This is not a simple layout exercise.</p>

                    <p>Write up a brief paragraph summarizing your reflections.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="sketch" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Sketch ten thumbnails</h2>
                    <p>It's time to start brainstorming concepts and designs for your site. Start sketching. We're looking for you to generate ten different concept thumbnails focusing on the interaction, information hierarchy, and overall layout. Each sketch should be about a quarter-page if you're using an 8.5"x11" sketchbook. They're intentionally postcard-sized so that you focus on the overall layout rather than detail. If you need multiple different sketches to capture a single idea, that's fine.</p>

                    <p>Try different user flows through the application, different grid structures, and calling attention to information through negative space. Aim for variety &mdash; diversity in your sketches will make it easier to find the design that you like best. Feel free to include color in your sketches if it would help convey your idea, but using grayscale is great too. One piece of advice: don't make it too complex, since you'll be implementing it soon.</p>

                <div id="ixn-layout" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Wireframe (Sketch)</h2>
                    <p>Pick your top three ideas and create rough mocks for each. These mocks are intended to evolve and instantiate your sketches given realistic constraints in screen size and layout.</p>

                    <p>If you can get your hands on a Mac, we strongly recommend the trial version of <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch for OS X</a>. (You can also install it on the cluster computers.) Its <a href="http://www.sketchappsources.com/">large library of templates</a> can give you tons of premade elements (especially helpful for this assignment: the <a href="http://bootstrapuikit.com/">Twitter Bootstrap UI elements</a>) so you don't need to reinvent everything from scratch. An alternative is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a> or Photoshop, available on Stanford cluster machines.

If you are truly stuck, tools such as Keynote or Powerpoint can work, but be aware that it can be difficult to use them to produce designs that look like they would be realistic web sites rather than slideware.</p>

                    <p>It's fine to use Sketch UI kits for default styles and buttons, since the focus isn't on visual design right now. Likewise, you can use Lorem Ipsum text if you need.</p>

                    <p>If you need to convey multiple states of the application &mdash; for example, a second page or an interactive widget &mdash; do so through separate screens in the mock.</p>

                    <p>Here are example Sketch mocks. Note that the visual design language leans in the general direction that will be used, but it uses a lot of pre-canned resources and is not final.</p>

                        <img class="img img-responsive col-md-4"src="../images/p2-sketch1.png" />

                <div id="ixn-layout" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Wireframe (HTML)</h2>
                    <p>Sketch isn't very interactive, so we'll pop over to HTML. Choose one of your three mocks to pursue further. Translate your mock into code using HTML and CSS, as well as minimal Javascript if necessary. The goal is to make an interactive (largely unstyled) wireframe that a user could click through to explore the general layout and interaction. Focus mostly on the details of the interaction, and less on the details of the content.</p>

                    <p>We advise you to use Twitter Bootstrap and the grid techniques from in class to implement the HTML mock. Bootstrap should come pre-baked with most HTML components you'd need. No server software should be necessary at this point.</p>

                    <p>Our critiques in studio will be focused on whether your design is focusing on the right elements of the interaction and information.</p>

                    <p>Here is the same example project shown above, but implemented in HTML using off-the-shelf components with a little refinement:</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <img class="img img-responsive col-md-4"src="../images/p2-html.png" />

                    <small>Courtesy of Julie Stanford and Sliced Bread Design</small>                    
                </div>                

                <!--
                <div id="examples" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Find examples</h4>
                    <p>Given your goals from above, go find other web sites and applications that communicate the same idea. You're welcome to find as many as you'd like, but screenshot and share at least four. Now it's time for a little critique. For each item, annotate it with one "I Like..." and one "I Wish..." statement. For example, "I like this guide's use of San Francisco iconography. It really makes the guide feel local.", and "I wish that the art deco theme weren't so overwrought." Do not focus on low-level usability problems &mdash; critique the design's high-level decisions.</p>
