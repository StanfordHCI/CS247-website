                    <h2>Final feedback and prototype</h2>
                    <p>Take your revised prototypes out to the field again. Based on your results, pick one to revise and refine further. Your end goal is a final prototype of your selected idea. Remember that this is still a prototype, so it's not expected to be a fully functioning piece of software. However, the better you can fake it, the more compellingly your prototype will communicate.</p>

                    <p>Write up a final summary: what need is being addressed? What approach are you taking? What feedback drove you toward the current design? And how does it work? Be sure to capture your prototype via video or photos.</p>

                    <h3>On Canvas</h3>
                    <p>Pull everything together into your submission for P3.III on Canvas. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A PDF with your final summary and prototype. Video optional.</li>

                    <h3>In Studio</h3>
                    <p>Present your final prototype in five minutes in studio. Cover the need being addressed, your high level insight, user feedback, and the prototype itself. Bring your prototype for show-and-tell.</p>
