    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <p>The goal of Part I: needfinding observation and interviews, and communicating ideas visually.</p>

                    <p><b>Needfinding is "deep hanging out".</b> CS 147 focused on contextual inquiry-style user research. Needfinding is a much broader activity that involves more open-ended observation and interviewing. We'll begin getting comfortable with that here.</p>

                    <!-- The first goal of P1 is to abandon a common error that new designers make: focusing on raw, surface-level description in needfinding. When students graduate from CS 147, typically their needfinding observations are still extremely surface-level (e.g., "It was loud, so we should find ways to make it quieter.") This time, the expectations are higher. We'll aim to turn those observations into focused needs.</p> -->

                    <p><b>Design requires communication.</b> The better your communication cuts to the core of the idea, the more effective you are as a designer. It's your responsibility to ensure that others see the same thing in your ideas that you do. If they see something else, you need to accept a <i>mea culpa</i>: there's something you're not communicating clearly. Visual communication is a kind of interface design: if the recipient doesn't rapidly get it, then the interface (communication) needs to be tweaked.</p>

                    <p>Your mission with Part I is to <b>perform needfinding on the Caltrain rider experience and capture it visually in sketches</b>. This quarter's theme is urban computing, so it's time that we pop the Stanford bubble, go off campus, and spend some time observing people waiting for the Caltrain and riding the Caltrain. Be a participant observer: ride the Caltrain yourself somewhere. Interview people to better understand how Caltrain fits into their commute and their lives. Visually capture the environment in sketches. Focus on observations for now, don't worry about deeper interpretations.</p>

                    <p>This is a pair assignment, so find a partner. While you will make one joint submission, both of you need to turn in observations and sketches for Part I.</p>

Three notes: First, last year's project was not focused on the Caltrain, and it was not framed around observations vs. interpretation. Second, while this project has great insights, it does rely too much on text instead of primarily using visuals to tell stories. Third, the formal requirements (in terms of what to capture, number of pages, and so on) were different --- pay attention mainly to how they did it rather than what they did.</p>

                    <h4>Equip yourself</h4>
                    <p>A good drawing pad or sketchbook is a critical part of the designer's toolkit. Make sure you've purchased a pad and pen you can take with you. Act quickly, because we are not the only class on campus that's asking you to buy a sketchbook and they do sell out.Important features: <b>you must be able to easily tear out the pages</b> (so we can tape them on the walls), no lines, no flimsy pages, no tiny pages (we recommend at least 5"x8"), no thin-lined pens (go for something with a reasonably thick ink stream), and no pencils. The Stanford Bookstore sells drawing pads, as does <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/University+Art/@37.473066,-122.217582,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808fbb3a2902b9fb:0x40d44f8e06f1dc56">University Art</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Accent+Arts/@37.426745,-122.144873,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808fbae5939d8a8d:0x51810dd03fc0d3d1">Accent Arts</a>.

                    <h4>Prepare to observe and interview</h4>
                    <p>You and your partner should think about: what are aspects of the experience that you want to make sure to see? Be broad. Don't just spend time on the platform. Plan to get on the train, take it somewhere, and observe what people are doing while they're riding. What do they do when they get off? Work to avoid any preconceptions you might have had about who is on the Caltrain and what they are doing.</p>

                    <p>Generate a few possible interview questions before you head out. A rough script can really help break the ice.</p>

                    <h4>Observe and interview at your location</h4>
                    <p>Once you're at your location, walk around and observe. Both of you take down some sketches to yourselves of what you see. Aim to capture at volume, don't worry about filtering to just great observations. Focus on specific stories and details. If you don't do this, it will be much harder to have the depth that you need for your later supporting evidence. Feel free to take pictures or audio recordings on your phone to complement for your own memory, but do not capture pictures and audio now and then sketch after the fact. You must sketch while you're there. For this section, you are not graded on your communication skills, mainly on your use of visual expression techniques from class and on observation.</p>

                    <p>Observe and sketch until it gets boring, then start talking to people. Without asking leading questions, see if the information you glean from them supports or refutes your observations. Make sure to sketch and capture important aspects of the conversation right after you finish talking to the person.</p>

                    <p>The deliverable here is a selection of no fewer than ten pages of your observations, per person, captured in a primarily visual form. Feel free to include other material as supplements at the end of the assignment submission &mdash; we will glance through them too.</p>

                    <p>Part I is worth <b>two points</b>. You will receive two points for completing the assignment satisfactorily, submitting it, and bringing your sketches to class.</p>

                    <p>However, apart from the points, this assignment will also feed into Part II. So, the course staff will separately give you in-class feedback on the quality of your submission on a check-minus, check, check-plus scale. If you get a check-minus, strongly consider redoing Part I before moving on to Part II, since your foundation is shaky. A check is fine, and the rare check-plus means that you've exceeded our expectations.</p>
