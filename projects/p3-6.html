    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

We will present your slide(s) behind you as you present, and will automatically go on to the next group after forty five seconds. Keep in mind that your audience are likely design experts.</p>

                    <h2>Poster</h2>
                    <p>You will need a <b>20"x30"</b> poster to tell judges about your project. This is a chance to show off your visual design skills. A common error is to put too much content on the poster. Keep it simple and convey the main concept. It should be geared towards pitching your project to viewers/judges and not about your design process. We will provide easels; you will need to print out and mount your poster on a stiff backing so that it can stand alone on the easel. Posters can be printed at <a href="https://acomp.stanford.edu/techlounge/posters">Lathrop</a>, <a href="http://www.costcophotocenter.com/Shop/Posters#/PosterBoards/posterboard/20x30">Costco($25)</a> or <a href="http://photo.walgreens.com/walgreens/info1/isfrom=_walgreens_posterscreateflow">Walgreens ($24)</a>. They usually have a 1-2 day turnaround. You can order online and pick it up from the store.</p>

                    <p>Bring it so you can show it off during the demo and poster session! The staff and judges will interact with it there. Prepare a user task or scenario (or maybe a small set of them) to run through on the prototype with visitors to your poster. Think in advance of how to demo your system with as little friction as possible. For example, can you have prepared accounts rather than needing everyone to make their own?</p>
