    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

You will iterate with the studio staff to refine your project's needs, ideas, studies, and prototypes. The project will culminate with an implemented prototype shown off to your adoring fans at the final project fair.</p>

In P3, you worked to deepen your needfinding insight and to prototype rapidly. Now, with P4, you will synthesize these skills toward an idea that you'll be prototyping in code.</p>

                    <p>This should be the most ambitious design project you've undertaken thus far. We aim to prove to you how much you've learned.</p>

                    <p>Project 4 is a multi-week, iterative design process to produce an implemented prototype in reaction to user needs on your studio's theme. The first two weeks mirror P3 to give us a chance to iterate, flare and explore. The final three weeks are focused on successively narrowing toward an implemented design.</p>

                    <p>We will be returning all feedback within 48 hours. Assignment deadlines will now vary by studio. Studio deadlines are:

                        <p>Your user group may or may not be accessible over Presidents' Day weekend, so we want you to be able to get a rapid start. Form a team of three from your studio. We suggest that you seek out teammates who bring together complementary skills and who have compatible schedules and priorities. If your studio cannot divide evenly into groups of three, the final group(s) can be two people.</p>

                        <p>Was there an idea in P3, even one that you didn't pursue, that you'd love to explore deeper? Did your P3 experience orient you toward a user group or a need that you didn't originally see? Reflect on your experiences so far with the studio theme and with your prototype feedback from P3.</p>

                        <p>You are welcome to choose any direction that fits within your studio theme. You may extend ideas from P3, or pivot and start with a new user group or need. The expectation will be that this second round of needfinding will carry you deeper, so it may take some time to set up the interviews and the trip. We'd also like to be able to give you feedback and connect you with relevant user groups when we can.</p>

                        <p>Decide on a rough needfinding plan, focusing on with whom and where you want to do your needfinding. If you are extending an idea from P3, we recommend finding a needfinding angle that can deepen your understanding of the needs and the stakeholders.</p>

                        <p>You will not be held to this needfinding plan, but it is our chance to give you feedback as early as possible.</p>

                    <p>Your assignment for Part I is to iterate on a second round of needfinding based on your experiences with P3. This will be a check-in rather than a formal assignment.</p>

                    <h4>Needfinding status update</h4>
                    <p>Design is an iterated process of flare and focus. In P3, you went through an expansion period, flaring out to new ideas through your needfinding and brainstorming, then a narrowing period, focusing in on specific ideas. Here, we will begin P4 by taking your insights from P3 and using them to flare again, this time armed with the knowledge and clearer purpose that comes from your experiences with P3.</p>

                    <p>Based on your reflections in Part 0, go perform a second round of needfinding. Follow the same general form as in P3: prepare a discussion guide, capture raw observations, then grab a whiteboard and post-its and synthesize them into interpretations and needs. Unless you have completely pivoted, connect your results back to the needfinding and user feedback from P3.</p>

                    <p>The deliverable for Part 1 is a status report on your needfinding. We hope to see, at the very least: a clear list of stakeholders, your status in planning your visit(s), and a set of interview questions you will be asking. You do not need to stick to just those interview questions — we encourage you to let the discussion flow.</p>

                    <p>If you have already performed your observations by this deadline, feel free to include your raw observations as well. We may be able to help you reflect on them.</p>

                <div id="needfinding-analysis">
                    <h4>Needfinding Analysis</h4>
                    <p>Execute on your needfinding plan and gather your observations. Once your observations are complete, it's time to synthesize the results. Once again, grab a whiteboard, and start by putting all your observations onto Post-It notes. Start grouping them, turning the observations into interpretations, and then regrouping as necessary. Aim to produce needs. Those needs will lead to "How Might We..." questions.</p>

                    <p>As part of your synthesis, generate three people profiles to capture different stakeholders or user groups. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hBcZuyHrgmr3cjRwsgiKO3rwcz2z-xv963EBkSaDp3w/edit?usp=sharing">(See a template here that you can copy and edit for your submission.)</a> People profiles ensure that you have enough depth on a perspective from your conversations to tell a story. They help your results become more emotionally resonant.</p>

                    <p>The rest of your needfinding report should take the same format as in P3. In particular, make sure to back up each interpretation and need with: 1) an observation, a quote or a picture; and 2) a "How Might We...?" question that you can use while brainstorming.</p>

                    <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
                    <p>As before, start with your "How Might We..." questions to flare and brainstorm a new set of design ideas. When brainstorming, remember to go for volume. You'll want at least 15 ideas, and probably many more. When you're done, brainstorm dark horse candidates as well.</p>

                    <p>As in P3, capture your ideas to share them with us. Sketch out ideas clearly for the staff the read and understand. You can use a combination of media if it's helpful.</p>

                <div id="selection">
                    <h4>Focus</h4>
                    <p>Once more, focus your brainstorm down to three ideas you would seriously consider pursuing and expand upon them. We encourage you to make one of them a dark horse candidate. Detail your design goals in writing. Then, sketch a storyboard to explain the idea. It should capture the users, their needs, and how your solution addresses those needs.</p>

                    <h4>Prepare for studio</h4>
                    <p>Be prepared to present your needfinding results and three ideas in a total of four minutes in studio. Slides may be an effective way to convey the main points.</p>

                    <p>Now that we've learned in class how to present design work, we will begin including points in the rubric for the quality of your in-studio presentation.</p>

                    <h2>Part III</h2>
                    <h4>deadlines by studio: february 28 / march 1 / march 2</h4>
                    <p>In Part III, we will iterate our idea toward a rough functional prototype. The final part of this week's assignment involves the first time you're writing code, so make sure that you give yourself enough time.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="crit-reaction">
                    <h4>Revisions and brainstorms</h4>
                    <p>First, reflect on the feedback you got in studio, and refresh your ideas. You are welcome to pivot, but make sure you are addressing the feedback you received.</p>

                    <p>Return to the brainstorming table. In light of the feedback, toss out new ideas. Take advantage of the distance you've gotten since your first brainstorm to go even wilder and deeper. Is anything sticking?</p>

                    <p>Based on your reflections and brainstorms, choose three designs you'll be moving forward with to prototype. Include one dark horse idea. Include a short writeup to detail the changes you made and explain your thinking behind those changes. The writeup should be at least a paragraph per design to fully explain the reflections and iteration you've done.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="prototype">
                    <h4>Three prototypes</h4>
                    <p>Once again, we'll prototype in parallel. Consider what question is the most important one to ask of each design, and how your prototype can answer just that question. Construct a rapid prototype for each idea.</p>

                    <p>Capture your questions and prototypes so that we can understand what you did. Include relevant materials (e.g., images, videos) and a short description.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="implement">
                    <h4>Rapid feedback</h4>
                    <p>And now we engage with users once more. As in P3, bring your three prototypes to enough users to get sufficient feedback, likely around four different people. Aim for a reasonable facsimile of your user group. If you have easy access to representative users for your designs, work with them. Otherwise, get as close as you can using the social capital you have at hand. Given that you will also be working on a skeleton functional prototype after this, plan ahead so you have time to grab a few users. Ask your studio staff if you need help.</p>

                    <p>Remember to use all your skills to make users not feel like they are being evaluated, and to capture observations. Write up a summary of your findings. First, describe your method and who you tested with. Second, tell us what you saw.</p>

                    <p>Third, tell us your interpretation and reflections. What did this second round of feedback imply about your original design questions that led to the prototypes? Has this activity uncovered any deeper insight into the design space?</p>
                </div>

                <div id="functional">
                    <h4>Skeleton functional prototype</h4>
                    <p>Reflecting on your study results, it is time to select an idea you want to pursue further. Which idea do you think speaks most deeply to a need, rather than a usability patch? Which idea addresses that need with a nontrivial design insight? Which one are you most excited to pursue? You are welcome to refine one of your three ideas, or pivot and pursue a new design. If you pivot, we encourage you to let your studio staff know about your new idea as soon as possible.</p>

                    <p>We will now focus and begin creating a prototype in code. Recall our guide to creating a prototype: focus on the most important unanswered question about your design. What do you need to create in order to answer that question?</p>

                    <p>Your final goal for this week is to create a skeleton functional prototype. A skeleton prototype is one that comprises the central interaction of your design in code, and nothing more. Don't make it pretty. Don't try to build out the whole idea. Keep it lightweight. Feel free to Wizard of Oz components that you will later implement. Fake any data or user accounts. Show us the general interaction scaffold that you'll be fleshing out in later weeks.</p>

                    <p>Consider this a <i>core-then-expand</i> approach to engineering where you start with a rapid minimum viable prototype and then iterate. Contrast this to a <i>modular execution</i> approach where you know the final architecture at the beginning and build it week by week in modular components. The modular approach, while attractive in other classes, is not a good match for design work — there is no point in building robust infrastructure when you are likely to toss it out or evolve the design.</p>

                    <p>Remember, there's no way that you can complete an overly ambitious prototype alongside your other goals for this week, even with three of you. Focus on just the most critical element and prototype just that in code. If you've focused your question correctly, your prototype will convey the most important aspect of the experience that you are envisioning.</p>

                    <p>You are welcome to use any platform you'd like. The TAs can provide technical support for web and mobile web.</p>

If you ever start talking about options or preferences or user logins, stop — you're not focusing on the right parts of the prototype. You can probably even fake most of the data in your application.

                    <h2>Final presentation</h2>
                    <h4>due friday march 13 @ 5pm</h4>
                    <p>This is it! Let's show everyone what you've been working on!</p>
                </div>

                <div id="feedback">
                    <h4>User feedback</h4>
                    <p>Follow up with the users that you scheduled last week. Keep working with users until you start noting the same observations over and over. This should involve at least five different users. (If the nature of your design means that your user group is extremely difficult to connect with, coordinate with your studio staff to decide on a realistic goal.)</p>

                    <p>For each user, set the stage and make sure they understand that you are testing the prototype, not them. Lay out tasks or goals that they are trying to achieve, and let them interact with your prototype. Make sure one of your team members is taking notes and recording any relevant media (e.g., photos, video). Another team member should guide the process. Encourage the user to follow a think-aloud protocol — you likely learned this technique in CS 147. Try your absolute hardest not to intervene. Watching helplessly as someone struggles to use your interface is one of the hardest, but most valuable, things you can do.</p>

                    <p>Afterwards, as with P3, it's time to synthesize. Convert your observations into sticky notes and start clustering them on a whiteboard. Identify themes, re-cluster, and discuss until your main reflections have settled.</p>

                    <p>Write up a report detailing your method, results, and reflections. Make sure to include: how will these reflections influence your final design efforts?</p>
                </div>                

                <div id="wk10-iterate">
                    <h4>Iterate</h4>
                    <p>Based on your feedback from your users and in your studio, iterate on your prototype so that it's ready for the final presentations. This is your last chance to pull out the stops!</p>
                </div>

                <div id="wk10-present">
                    <h4>Presentation</h4>
                    <p>There will be three components to your final presentation.</p>

                    <p>First, a forty five-second pitch to the audience. You are welcome to design your pitch however any way that you feel will be compelling. We will present your slide(s) behind you as you present, and will automatically go on to the next group after forty five seconds. Keep in mind that your audience are likely design experts.</p>

                    <p>Second, a poster to tell judges about your project. This is a chance to show off your visual design skills. A common error is to put too much content on the poster. Keep it simple and convey the main concept. We will provide easels; you will need to print out and bring your poster.</p>

                    <p>Third, your prototype. Bring it so you can show it off during the demo and poster session! The staff and judges will interact with it there. Prepare a user task or scenario (or maybe a small set of them) to run through on the prototype with visitors to your poster. Think in advance of how to demo your system with as little friction as possible. For example, can you have prepared login accounts rather than needing everyone to make their own?</p>
                </div>

                <div id="final-reflections">
                    <h4>Class and team reflection</h4>
                    <p>It's important that we as the staff have a sense of how your team dynamics played out. All members of the team need to separately fill out this Google Form (link TBA) to share reflections on CS 247 and their team's work balance.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="wk10-submit">
                    <h4>Submit</h4>
                    <p>Pull everything together into your P4 submission folder. That includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A PDF with your final poster.</li>
                        <li>If you can share it with us, a link to your final prototype. If you can't share it, we'd appreciate a short movie showing it off.</li>
                        <li>Don't forget to fill out the class and team reflection form.</li>
