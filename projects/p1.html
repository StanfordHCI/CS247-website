    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                  Assignment goals (4-5 hours): 4 units * 3 hrs = 12 hrs
                  - be able to communicate observations visually
                  - capture visually in volume
                  - communicate visually an idea

                  Part 1: observe people meeting up socially and draw what you see. Capture the surroundings visually --- what are evocative objects and surroundings? Capture fifteen instances of things going well (socially smooth) and ten instances of social breakdowns you observe. Now envision three new social experiences that the downtown designers might create. First sketch them to yourself, then for each one sketch a one-page vision of that experience.

                <div id="brief" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <p class="lead">CS 247 takes many of the concepts you learned in introductory design coursework and deepens them. You are no longer an amateur, so we won't be treating you like one. We look forward to seeing you leap over our already-high expectations.</p>
                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>Design requires communication. The better your communication cuts to the core of the idea, the more effective you are as a designer. It's your responsibility to ensure that others see the same thing in your ideas that you do. If they see something else, you need to accept a <i>mea culpa</i>: there's something you're not communicating clearly. Visual communication is a kind of interface design: if the recipient doesn't rapidly get it, then the interface (communication) needs to be tweaked.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your visual communication skills. (And, if you're like me, to prove to yourself that visual communication can be effective even without years of artistic training.) You will not be graded on your artistic abilities. You will be graded on whether you communicate your ideas in a clear and engaging manner. Utilize the tools and techniques that we covered in the first lecture and associated reading.</p>

                    <p>For Project 1, your mission is to <b>capture social experiences on the town</b>. Pop the Stanford bubble and go off campus to any busy area and time where people are meeting up socially â€” San Francisco's Dolores Park, Mountain View's Castro Street, or even downtown Palo Alto. Marguerite, Caltrain and BART open up a wide variety of interesting environments. Pick any venue you are interested in observing. You will visually capture the environment, social successes in that environment, and social breakdowns in that environment.</p>

                    <p>If accessibility constraints would make it difficult for you to execute this assignment, please post (anonymously if you wish) to the class forum. In particular, please envision an alternate means of observing and communicating your observations to others, and share it in your post. If it sounds good to us, we'll OK it!</p>

                    <p>Please post any questions about this project or others to the class forum.</p>

                <div id="prep" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Equip yourself</h4>
                    <p>A good sketchbook is a critical part of the designer's toolkit. Make sure you've purchased a sketchbook and pen you can take with you. Important features: no lines, no flimsy pages, no tiny sketchbooks (we recommend at least 5"x8"), and no weak, thin pens. The Stanford Bookstore sells sketchbooks. Moleskine makes some great ones (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Classic-Notebook-Large-Notebooks/dp/8883701143/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1420064738&sr=8-2&keywords=moleskine">example</a>), and Amazon Prime Student can get them to you very quickly.</p>

                    <p>Then, make sure you've finished this week's reading linked on the syllabus. In your sketchbook, practice your star people, blob people, and other techniques from this week's class.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="observe" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>1) Observe at your location</h4>
                    <p>Once you're at your location, walk around and observe. Take down some sketches to yourself of what you see. Aim to capture at volume, don't worry about filtering to just great observations. Feel free to take pictures or audio recordings on your phone to supplement for your own memory.</p>

                    <p>Your goal will be to capture the milieu and activities of this location so that others who have never been there can understand its dynamics. Pay attention to the people, the environment, and how the design of the environment is influencing how, when and where the people interact. What are the focal points of the space, where people meet up and hang out? Why? What areas do they avoid, and why? Is there an ebb and flow to the space, or is it static?</p>

                    <p>Start by taking sketches for yourself, not for communication purposes. Just capture what you see and ideas as they come to you.</p>

                    <p>Keep all your sketches for this section. The deliverable here is at least five pages of observations captured in a primarily visual form.</p> 
                </div>

                <div id="environment" class="sidenav-anchor">                
                    <h4>2) The environment</h4>
                    <p>Now that you've spent some time observing and capturing ideas and events, it's time to start communicating this environment to others. Your second deliverable is to visually describe the environment as it is impacting the social behaviors of the people in that space. <b>Do not create a schematic or map.</b> Capture the most salient aspects of the environment. Is it the traffic flow and how people take advantage of that to go for long rambling walks? Is there a fountain that's a focal point of the place? Do people congregate to chat at sidewalk cafes or stoplights? Where are the loners, and why? Where are the big groups, and why? Each location has its own character, so capture whatever you feel to be the most important themes and elements of its social design and of the people in it.</p>

                    <p>With this and other components of the assignment, use any visual tools at your disposal. Shapes, words, people, abstractions, whatever would help someone understand.</p>

                    <p>Turn in scans of no more than four pages from your sketchbook for this deliverable. Whereas the prior deliverable was about sketching for you, the goal from here on is for your sketches to communicate the environment to the reader. You are welcome to include as much other material and self-study sketches as you want in bulk as supplemental sketches, and we will look at them as well.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="successes" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>3) Social successes</h4>
                    <p>Time to focus more on the people. Start by freeform sketching the people in the environment. Focus on social successes: what are social engagements people are participating in? Look for situations where everything really seems to be clicking. Is the environment supporting that success, or is it simply a backdrop? Capture specific instances, as well as broader patterns.</p>

                    <p>Now, in your sketchbook, work to communicate the nature of these social successes to others. Don't be afraid to go big and spend an entire page or more capturing a pattern in a visually compelling manner. Again, don't be descriptive or schematic --- aim to communicate an implicit story using your static images. Your goal is for a viewer to understand what the social success is, and why it might be particularly well-suited to that environment.</p>

                    <p>Turn in scans of no more than three pages for this deliverable. As before, feel free to include other material and self-study sketches as you want as supplements as well.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="failures" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>4) Social breakdowns</h4>
                    <p>The fourth deliverable is the same as the third, but this time, focus on social <i>breakdowns</i>. Watch for slips, mistakes, missed connections, or social interactions that don't go as well as they should. Sketch to yourself what's going on.</p>

                    <p>Now, as before, communicate visually a few of the most salient breakdowns, and ways in which the environment might be contributing to them. Are people tripping over each other on the sidewalk? Friends not able to hear each other? No safety from the weather?</p>

                    <p>The deliverables are identical to before: three pages, plus any supplemental material you want.</p>
