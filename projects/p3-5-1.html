    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <p>In Part IV, you put pedal to the metal to create a functional prototype.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="functional" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Skeleton functional prototype</h2>
                    <p>Reflecting on your study results, it is time to select an idea you want to pursue further. Which idea do you think speaks most deeply to a need, rather than a usability patch? Which idea addresses that need with a nontrivial design insight? Which one are you most excited to pursue? You are welcome to refine one of your three ideas, or pivot and pursue a new design. If you pivot, we encourage you to let your studio staff know about your new idea as soon as possible.</p>

                    <p>Start with a skeleton functional prototype. A skeleton prototype is one that comprises the central interaction of your design in code, and nothing more. Don't make it pretty. Don't try to build out the whole idea. Keep it lightweight. Feel free to Wizard of Oz components that you will later implement. Fake any data or user accounts — don't build any back end code if you can avoid it. If you've focused your question correctly, your prototype will convey the most important aspect of the experience that you are envisioning.</p>

                    <p>Once you have a skeleton prototype ready, make sure to show it at studio. You are welcome to use any platform you'd like. The TAs can provide technical support for web and mobile web.</p>

                <div id="refined" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Visual design and refined prototype</h2>
                    <p>Once the skeleton is complete, flesh out your prototype. Reflect on our lessons from the visual design component of class: start with visual information hierarchy, then think about grids, layout, negative space, color, fonts, and more.</p>

                    <p>It's a prototype and not a demo: it doesn't need to be complete. If you ever start talking about options or preferences or user logins, stop — you're not focusing on the right parts of the prototype. You can probably even fake most of the data in your application. We don't expect a live database. However, the prototype should be sufficiently mature now so that you can get user feedback on the main interaction flow and needs.</p>

                        <li>One short movie or screencast (between 1-2 minutes) of your current prototype. Add descriptive text or voiceover so that we can tell what's going on. If your prototype is implemented for the web, we would strongly encourage you to include a link.</li>
