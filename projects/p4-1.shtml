                        <p>As with P3, pick a topic of dialogue in the campus or national environment, and identify a point of view that you feel is under-represented. You may re-use any team's topic, point of view, or design from P3, or generate a new one. Your goal is to design an interactive experience that convinces people of the point of view. Don't just create an informational web site: think about how to engage the user.</p>

                <div id="sketch" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Sketch ten thumbnails</h2>
                    <p>It's time to start brainstorming designs. Start sketching. We're looking for you to generate ten different concept thumbnails focusing on the interaction, information hierarchy, and overall layout. Each sketch should be about a quarter-page if you're using an 8.5"x11" sketchbook. They're intentionally postcard-sized so that you focus on the overall layout rather than detail. If you need multiple different sketches to capture a single idea, that's fine.</p>

                    <p>Try different user flows through the application, different grid structures, and calling attention to information through negative space. Aim for variety &mdash; diversity in your sketches will make it easier to find the design that you like best. Feel free to include color in your sketches if it would help convey your idea, but using grayscale is great too. One piece of advice: don't make it too complex, since you'll be implementing it soon.</p>

                    <p>Here is an example sketch for a project building a physician newsleter portal:</p>

                <div id="ixn-layout" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Three Sketch Wireframes</h2>
                    <p>Pick your top three ideas and create rough mocks for each. These mocks are intended to evolve and instantiate your sketches given realistic constraints in screen size and layout.</p>

                    <p>If you can get your hands on a Mac, we strongly recommend the trial version of <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch for OS X</a>. (You can also install it on the cluster computers.) Its <a href="http://www.sketchappsources.com/">large library of templates</a> can give you tons of premade elements (especially helpful for this assignment: the <a href="http://bootstrapuikit.com/">Twitter Bootstrap UI elements</a>) so you don't need to reinvent everything from scratch. An alternative is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a> or Photoshop, available on Stanford cluster machines. Many of the UI template libraries work with these tools as well. However, they have high learning curves. If you are truly stuck, tools such as Keynote or Powerpoint can work, but be aware that it can be difficult to use them to produce designs that look like they would be realistic web sites rather than slideware. It's fine to use Sketch UI kits for default styles and buttons, since the focus isn't on visual design right now. Likewise, you can use Lorem Ipsum text if you need.</p>

                    <p>If you need to convey multiple states of the application &mdash; for example, a second page or an interactive widget &mdash; do so through separate screens in the mock.</p>

                    <p>Here are example Sketch mocks. Note that the visual design language leans in the general direction that will be used, but it uses a lot of pre-canned resources and is not final.</p>

                        <img class="img img-responsive col-md-4"src="../images/p2-sketch1.png" />
                        <img class="img img-responsive col-md-4"src="../images/p2-sketch2.png" />
                        <img class="img img-responsive col-md-4"src="../images/p2-sketch3.png" />
                    </div>

                    <p>We recommend making sure to get feedback in studio at this point, before narrowing down to a single design to pursue!</p>

                <div id="ixn-layout" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>One Marvel Wireframe</h2>
                    <p>Sketch isn't very interactive, so we'll connect it with <a href="https://marvelapp.com/">Marvel</a>. Choose one of your three designs to pursue further. Expand your wireframe so that its main interaction flows are all present and possible to click through in Marvel.</p>

                    <p>Our critiques in studio will be focused on whether your design is focusing on the right elements of the interaction and information.</p>

                    <h4>Find examples</h4>
                    <p>Given your goals from above, go find other web sites and applications that communicate the same idea. You're welcome to find as many as you'd like, but screenshot and share at least four. Now it's time for a little critique. For each item, annotate it with one "I Like..." and one "I Wish..." statement. For example, "I like this guide's use of San Francisco iconography. It really makes the guide feel local.", and "I wish that the art deco theme weren't so overwrought." Do not focus on low-level usability problems &mdash; critique the design's high-level decisions.</p>
