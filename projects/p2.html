    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                        <p class="lead">P2 focuses on interaction design for the web. Its goal is for you to deeply engage with interaction design tradeoffs: for example, positive and negative space, color, and energy and tension. You will learn to prototype these aspects rapidly and in multiple tools. You will get your first experience with iterated critique in studio. And you will exercise your implementation skills to instantiate your idea.</p>

                <div id="goals" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p>The goal of this assignment: exercise your interaction design skills. There are two components to interaction design for the web, each of which we will tackle in one week's deliverable: 1) mockup development, and 2) front-end implementation.</p>

                    <p>Now that you are comfortable communicating your ideas in visual form, we can work to design experiences that are visually and interactively engaging. In the first week, you will brainstorm and prototype several ideas. In studio, you will get them critiqued.</p>

                    <p>Inspiration needs perspiration. So, in the second week, you will focus on implementing one of your designs in static HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
                </div>
                    
                <div id="brief" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>Your prompt for P2 is to <b>design a portfolio for your work</b>. All designers worth their salt have <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/portfolios/examples-712368">a portfolio on the web to showcase their design skills and past work</a>. A portfolio is an interactive resume. Employers will look at them before interviewing a candidate, and fellow designers will look at them to familiarize themselves with your strengths. In your portfolio, you will show off your own design work: from CS 147, d.school classes, any independent work, P1, your CS 142 project, or even coding projects. Some companies have even started offering <a href="https://www.behance.net">tools to automatically curate your portfolio</a>, but portfolios you've created yourself always stand out more.</p>

                    <p>If you already have a design portfolio that is up to P2's standards, you have two choices. Option 1: take this assignment as an opportunity to redesign your porfolio. (You know you've been meaning to do it anyway.) Option 2: instead of designing a portfolio, create a homepage for a group or organization that you belong to. If you want to take Option 2, show your existing portfolio to your studio instructor and TA, and propose your alternative, to get their OK.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="assignment" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Week 2 deliverable</h2>
                    <p>Your assignment for week 2 is to generate multiple concepts for your portfolio and instantiate them as static mocks.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="moodboard" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Thesis and mood board</h4>
                    <p>Think about what kind of message you want to send with your portfolio. What aspect of your identity, skills, or past projects do you want to communicate most vividly? We'll design your porfolio around that thesis. For example, your portfolio's goal might be to: 1) express your interest in front-end engineering, or 2) demonstrate your skills with color, or 3) communicate that you've got a <a href="http://lsjumb.stanford.edu/">weird and wacky</a> streak. <b>Write down this thesis, or potentially two or three if you want to try out different approaches with different prototypes.</b></p>

                    <p>Then, for your thesis, <b>create a mood board</b> as described in class. Search for concepts, photos, color swatches, illustrations, shapes, and anything else that conveys your thesis. Collect the ones you like into a page that is at least 8.5"x11". Powerpoint and Keynote should be plenty powerful for this purpose, but pick any digital layout tool you like. If you have multiple theses, we recommend informally creating one mood board for each thesis, but you will only need to turn in one.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="sketch" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Sketch six concepts</h4>
                    <p>Now that you have a thesis and a mood board, it's time to start brainstorming concepts for your portfolio. Spend some time with your sketchbook and your mood board, and sketch out different approaches to the design of your portfolio. How will you turn the thesis and mood board into an actual web page? Generate as many ideas as you can.</p>

                    <p>Pick six of your favorite ideas and sketch them out in a bit more detail. They should contain enough detail that a friend (or, well, the instructor) can clearly picture what the web site would look like. For example, all the major design elements need to be present, but details such as exact text to describe projects can be scribbled. Feel free to include color in your sketches if it would help convey your idea, or get creative with your pen (e.g., crosshatching) to convey everything in grayscale.</p>

                    <p>While you're welcome to assume any non-phone form factor, we recommend that you design for a standard laptop display. Think about what should show up "above the fold" (without any clicking or scrolling) that will grab the viewer's attention and encourage them to scroll down or interact with the site.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="prototype" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Prototype three concepts</h4>
                    <p>Your final deliverable for this week is to create static mock prototypes for your favorite three concepts, in three different tools. Part of the point here is to get you feeling comfortable with these mock tools. Often you would mock everything up in the same tool, but we're going for diversity here so that you can make informed decisions about which tools you like for future projects.</p>

                    <p>These mockups should convey the concept clearly and in reasonable detail. It should make clear how you plan to use color, negative space, balance and tension. The content should be clearly included in the mockup &mdash; copy text can be <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">lorem ipsum'ed</a> (or <a href="http://hipsum.co/">hipster ipsum'ed</a>) for now.</p>

                    <p>If your design idea will react to the user's input (e.g., using Javascript) or has multiple pages, make sure to include all the major page states or pages. Hyperlink them together appropriately so that the mock is interactive.</p>

                    <p>The mocks should be a close approximation of what you're proposing to build. Don't get overly ambitious, or next week's implementation will be hairy! Aim to complete any assets you need, e.g., images and backgrounds, since otherwise you'll be needing to create them next week on top of the site implementation.</p>

                    <p>Choose to prototype one design in each of three types of tools. Pick one tool from each category. They are listed here in increasing level of fidelity. All should have free trials available:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Paper</b>: sketched out in detail in your sketchbook, then scanned in and made interactive digitally. Recommended tool: your sketchbook + <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>. InVision has given CS 247 complementary educational accounts: sign up <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup">with this education link</a> and use the free account code we posted on Piazza. Alternatives: Keynote/Powerpoint with hyperlinking.</li>
                            <li><b>Wireframe</b>: a digital "sketch" that gives you a set of WYSIWYG elements to mirror the web's vocabulary. Recommended tool: <a href="http://www.proto.io/">proto.io</a>. Alternatives: <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>.
                            <li><b>Pixel-perfect mock</b>: a mockup that aims to mimic exactly what the final webpage will look like. Typically, designers or engineers then take these mocks and then aim to replicate them in real code. The screens are typically created with a vector tool, then exported and connected elsewhere to make them interactive. Recommended tool: <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch for OS X</a>, and InVision for connecting the screens. Alternatives: <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a> or Photoshop, available on Stanford cluster machines.</li>

                    <p>Pull everything together into your P2 submission folder. That includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One PDF that contains your thesis (or theses), mood board, and six sketched concepts.
                        <li>A separate PDF for each mock. We prefer offline/downloadable renderings, since they will last permanently. If the tool doesn't allow this, you can submit a link to the sharable live version on the web.</li>

                    <p>You presented and went through a design crit in studio. Grab the notes that your studiomate (hopefully) took, and think through them. Try to understand what the feedback is intending, and  why people are reacting to your designs the way they are. Write one paragraph reporting back the main idea of your critiques. </p>

                    <p>Pick one design concept that you are going to move forward with. Back to the sketchbook! Use your synthesis of the critique to rethink parts of your design, or your entire approach. Sketch out revised components of your portfolio, or changes to the overall flow and layout &mdash; whatever makes sense based on the feedback. Remember, critiques aren't intended to just give you usability feedback; they aim to question deeper aspects of your design. If you think you can address the feedback with a different solution than the one the instructor or your peers suggested, go for it. However, it is your responsibility to address the critique with your revision.</p>

                    <p>When you have something you're happy with, write a paragraph explaining how you aimed to address the critique (and any additional criteria you had) with your revision.</p>

This mock should aim to capture your portfolio as closely as possible, at a near-pixel level.

However, we advise you to make the web site static: that is, it shouldn't require server software such as Rails, node.js, or PHP. Nearly any portfolio can be implemented using static HTML, CSS and Javascript. Getting a server framework in the loop will eat too much valuable time.</p>
