    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p>Part II is a pivotal moment for your project — its goal is to make sense of your observations, and to brainstorm possible solutions.</p>
                </div>


                <div id="interpretation" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Interpretation</h2>
                    <p>It's time to synthesize your needfinding results. Once again, grab a whiteboard, and start by putting all your observations onto Post-It notes. Start grouping them, turning your raw observations into <em>interpretations</em>, and then regrouping as necessary. Aim to produce needs. Remember, needs are <em>verbs</em> (activities or desires that your user could use some help). They are not nouns (solutions). Focus on what people <em>say or do</em> versus what they might <em>think or feel</em>. If you want a reminder of these terms and methods, check the needfinding lecture and reading, or look at the <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BootcampBootleg2010v2SLIM.pdf">d.school Bootcamp Bootleg</a>. 

                    <p>Those needs will lead to <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/HMW-METHODCARD.pdf">How Might We...?" questions</a>. Do not submit a raw dump of materials; rather, organize a subset of your most salient, insightful or inspiring observations and interpretations. In practice, having good observations and insights is just half the bill. </p>

                    <p>The rest of your needfinding report should take the same format as in P1. In particular, make sure to back up each interpretation and need with: 1) an observation, a quote or a picture; and 2) a "How Might We...?" question that you can use while brainstorming.</p>

		  <div id="flare" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Flare</h4>
                    <p>Now it's time to synthesize your needfinding results into design concepts. Work with your team to brainstorm together on whiteboards, sketchbooks, artisinal cheese scraps &mdash; whatever it takes.</p>

                    <p>Start with your "How Might We..." questions that ground your brainstorm with actionable problems. Sketch out enough ideas until you find a set that you’re inspired to explore further. It should be at least 15 ideas, and probably many more. This brainstorm should be wild and broad. Use the brainstorming techniques from class. Again, focus not on usability patches, but deeper design innovations.</p>

                    <p>Once you hit saturation — and this may take multiple brainstorms — capture your ideas to share them with us. Sketch out those ideas clearly for the staff the read and understand. You can use a combination of media if it's helpful.

                <div id="focus" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Focus</h4>
                    <p>Select ideas that you would like to pursue — we suggest two — and expand on them a bit further. Sketch out the broader interaction context of how you imagine these ideas being used. Include who the users are, the major needs those users bring to the situation, and how your design solution addresses the needs.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="darkhorse" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Dark Horse</h4>

                    <p>Now that you've identified some design directions you like, it's time to change tack and include a <i>dark horse</i> idea. A dark horse, in horse racing, is a contender who most people don't think will win, but may turn in an unexpectedly strong performance and produce a huge payoff. Dark horse ideas are intended to be something far out there or nearly impossible. In the best case, your dark horse ideas might end up winning the race. However, even in the worst case, they can give us tremendous design insight and prevent design fixation, where the design space shrinks too rapidly.</p>

                    <p>There are three requirements for dark horse ideas. First, they must be "dark": they must explore a space that is risky, radical, infeasible, and/or in a direction orthogonal to previously explored solutions. They should feel slightly uncomfortable. Second, they must be brainstormed after the more traditional ideas — you can't have a dark path without a traditional "light" path to contrast it against. Third, they must be refined enough that they could be prototyped and objectively tested. That is, it cannot be infeasible: it needs to be something that we could put in front of real people to see whether it would work.</p>

                    <p>If you have dark horse ideas that came up in your initial brainstorm, you can use that. If you're not satisfied, brainstorm some! Try using <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/groups/k12/wiki/faf1d/Powers_of_Ten.html">Powers of Ten</a> and other techniques to push further and generate even more. After you brainstorm and sketch out dark horse ideas, choose one that you'd like to include among your set of two top candidates from before. Expand on your dark horse idea like you did for the previous top two ideas.</p>
