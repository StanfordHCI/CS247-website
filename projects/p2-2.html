    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

Gather more observations, interview more people, and gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of interest. Improve your interpretations and your How Might We? questions.

Bring it to class on the final due date and use it to present your findings. You are welcome to do creative sketching, cutting, and gluing onto a posterboard, or to make the poster digitally and print it out on a poster printer. Remember the principles of effective visual communitation: the poster should not be a braindump, but instead an effective communicator of your main results.</p>
