    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                        <p class="lead">P3 is our deep dive into need-driven design and rapid prototyping. With a partner, you'll be doing needfinding around your studio theme and translating those needs into design ideas. You'll then be challenged to create rapid prototypes of these ideas. These ideas will provide a foundation for P4, the final project.</p>

                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p>The goal of P3 is to help abandon two common errors that new designers make. Error 1: focusing on raw description in needfinding, and then designing to patch surface-level problems. Error 2: going too deep when prototyping.</p>

                    <p>Project 3 also initializes our experiences with the studio theme. We'll be continuing this with P4, the final project.</p>

                <div id="brief" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Brief</h2>

                    <p>Find a partner in your studio: P3 will be completed in groups of two.</p>

                    <p>Your goal is to perform needfinding within the domain of your studio, use those insights to generate a number of design ideas, and then rapidly prototype and evaluate those ideas.</p>

                    <p>We are doing a focused pass through the user-centered design process in two weeks. This brisk pace is intentional: it forces us to make tradeoffs in our prototypes and focus on the most important elements, rather than trying to implement everything.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="assignment" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Part I deliverable</h2>
                    <h4>due monday february 2 @ 11:59am</h4>
                    <p>Your assignment for Part I is to perform needfinding within your studio theme and use the insights to generate design ideas.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="needfinding" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Needfinding</h4>
                    <p>Your teaching team has introduced you to the studio's theme and given you ideas for possible needfinding opportunities. Now, think about locations and people that could lend you insight into the theme. Your first goal is to perform needfinding and synthesize your observations into a set of needs and insights.</p>

                    <p>Your studio instructors have high expectations here that you can move beyond simple descriptions and dig into new perspectives on people and their goals. A common studio instructor concern with P1 submissions was that the observations were far too surface-level. In addition, take care to avoid Stanford-world problems. Stanford-world problems are issues that are overly focused on a student worldview, or even too focused on Silicon Valley stereotype behavior. If you're studying play, for example, don't go do your needfinding at a campus party, or design apps that help you and your friends get together in the evenings.</p>

                    <h5>Prepare</h5>
                    <p>Look past what's readily accessible and focus on people and environments that will teach us something. For example, if you're studying health, Vaden is nearby but doesn't give you new perspectives, so avoid it. Then identify relevant stakeholders — people directly involved or implicated in the activity. For example, if you are interested in elder care, potential stakeholders include the elderly being cared for, family members, and health care professionals. </p>

                    <p>Next, put together a discussion guide of questions and topics to cover when you go out on your interviews. The <a href="../readings/needfinding-patnaik.pdf">Asking Questions section in this week's reading</a> should help.</p>

                    <p>Pay attention to the distinct stakeholders and the settings, people and things that engage them. What works and what does not? Observe and talk with everyone you can! What are the practices and goals of the various participants? How are they different? How are they similar? How do they succeed or fail? Can you find and observe any "extreme participants" who can provide deeper design insight?</p>

                    <p>Each studio instructor has offered some suggested needfinding venues:</p>

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Observe</h5>
                    <p>Capture the conversations, behaviors, and the environment in your sketchbook. These are your <i>observations</i>. Focus on specific stories and details. If you don't do this, it will be much harder to have the depth that you need for your later supporting evidence. You won’t know until later that something is important, so record everything you can: notes, audio, video, and more. There's lots to record, so don't spend time synthesizing yet.</p>

                    <h5>Analyze</h5>
                    <p>After you're done, synthesize these raw materials into <i>interpretations</i>. Make sure you call out <i>needs</i>. If you need a reminder of these terms and methods, check this week's lecture and reading, or look at the <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BootcampBootleg2010v2SLIM.pdf">d.school Bootcamp Bootleg</a>.

                    <p>The method we recommend: put your observations on stickies and organize, reorganize, and reorganize them. Keep discussing what you've found, what patterns are in the data, contradictions, things that people say are fine but are clearly too cumbersome, and so on. Set aside a large block of time to do this. It cannot be rushed. It often takes longer than the interviews themselves because you are working to pull out all the nuggets.</p>

                    <p>Your report should contain a combination of text, images, sketches, and potentially other media. Work to produce a number of "How Might We...?" questions that can inspire specific brainstorms. Do not submit a raw dump of materials; rather, organize a subset of your most salient, insightful or inspiring observations and interpretations. In practice, having good observations and insights is just half the bill. Being able to communicate them effectively in an emotionally appealing and data-driven manner is another very important aspect of being a designer or a UX researcher.</p>

                    <p>In particular, back up each interpretation and need with: 1) an observation, a quote or a picture; and 2) a "How Might We...?" question that you can use while brainstorming.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="brainstorm" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Flare: brainstorm</h4>
                    <p>Now it's time to synthesize your needfinding results into design concepts.Work with your partner to brainstorm together on whiteboards, sketchbooks, artisinal cheese scraps &mdash; whatever it takes.</p>

                    <p>Start with your "How Might We..." questions that ground your brainstorm with actionable problems. Sketch out enough ideas until you find a set that you’re inspired to explore further. It should be at least 15 ideas, and probably many more. This brainstorm should be wild and broad. Use the brainstorming techniques from class. Again, focus not on usability patches, but deeper design innovations.</p>

                    <p>Once you hit saturation — and this may take multiple brainstorms — capture your ideas to share them with us. Sketch out those ideas clearly for the staff the read and understand. You can use a combination of media if it's helpful.
                </div>

                <div id="darkhorse" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Focus: elaborate</h4>
                    <p>Select ideas that you would like to pursue — we suggest two — and expand on them a bit further. Tell us: what are the goals of the design? For example, <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/get-started/creative-vision.html">Google's Android design goals</a> are: delight me in surprising ways, simplify my life, and make me amazing (e.g., grant me special powers). Which aspects of your design focus on each goal, or are there other goals you are pursuing? Sketch out the broader interaction context of how you imagine these ideas being used. Include who the users are, the major needs those users bring to the situation, and how your design solution addresses the needs.</p>

                    <p>Now that you've identified some design directions you like, it's time to change tack and select <i>dark horse</i> ideas. A dark horse, in horse racing, is a contender who most people don't think will win, but may turn in an unexpectedly strong performance and produce a huge payoff. Dark horse ideas are intended to be something far out there or nearly impossible. In the best case, your dark horse ideas might end up winning the race. However, even in the worst case, they can give us tremendous design insight and prevent design fixation, where the design space shrinks too rapidly.</p>

                    <p>There are three requirements for dark horse ideas. First, they must be "dark": they must explore a space that is risky, radical, infeasible, and/or in a direction orthogonal to previously explored solutions. They should feel slightly uncomfortable. Second, they must be brainstormed after the more traditional ideas — you can't have a dark path without a traditional path to contrast it against. Third, they must be refined enough that they could be prototyped and objectively tested. That is, it cannot be infeasible: it needs to be something that we could put in front of real people to see whether it would work.</p>

                    <p>Start your brainstorm with any dark horse ideas that came up in your initial brainstorm. Try using <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/groups/k12/wiki/faf1d/Powers_of_Ten.html">Powers of Ten</a> and other techniques to push further and generate even more. After you brainstorm and sketch out dark horse ideas, choose one that you'd like to include among your set of two top candidates from before. Expand on it like the previous top two ideas.</p>

                    <h2>Part II deliverable</h2>
                    <h4>due monday february 9 @ 11:59am</h4>
                    <p>Your assignment for Part II is to iterate your designs based on the critique you received in studio, and then create rapid prototypes of the ideas for user feedback.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="crit-reaction" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Revisions and brainstorms</h4>
                    <p>Based on your feedback in studio and in writing, refresh and update your design ideas. Based on the feedback, you may want to toss out your previous designs and brainstorm new ones, or refine your original proposals.</p>

                    <p>The in-person and written critique is intended to help you reflect on your needfinding and your designs. Trampoline off of it to refine or pivot. Remember, critiques aren't intended to just give you usability feedback; they aim to question deeper aspects of your design. If you think you can address the feedback with a different solution than the one the instructor or your peers suggested, go for it. However, it is your responsibility to address the critique with your revision.</p>

                    <p>Your end goal will be to choose three designs, one of which is a dark horse, to prototype in the next step. Capture the current designs in sketches, and include a short writeup to detail the changes you made and explain your thinking behind those changes. The writeup should be at least a paragraph per design to fully explain the reflections and iteration you've done.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="prototype" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h4>Three prototypes</h4>
                    <p>Much like Horcruxes, one should not place all their faith in a single prototype. As we've discussed in class, having multiple parallel prototypes produces better final designs.</p>

                    <p>Your goal now is to prototype all three of your design ideas. Too often, designers and engineers get deeply invested in taking a week or a month or multiple months to produce a single prototype, only to find that it doesn't address the user needs. The explicit goal of this assignment is to challenge ourselves to generate convincing but rapid prototypes.</p>

                    <p>Prototypes are, by nature, incomplete and low-res. As <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/BootcampBootleg2010v2SLIM.pdf">the d.school bootleg says</a>, your goal is not to create a mockup or scale model, but to create experiences to which your users can react.</p>

                    <p>The crux of this assignment will be figuring out how to prototype each idea quickly and convincingly, without sinking untold hours into them. If you spend too much time creating prototypes, you won't have time to do rapid user testing at the end of the assignment. Forcing ourselves to make tradeoffs is the entire reason that the time limit on this deliverable is one week. Do not attempt to flesh out the entire design to uniform depth.</p>

                    <p>Instead, before you start the prototype, explicitly make a list of the questions that you have about your idea and the hypotheses you have about the answer to each question. Remember that each prototype asks a question. So, what's your design ideas's biggest unanswered question? Once you've decided on the question,  figure out what kind of prototype you would need to build and how you would get feedback from users to answer it. Don’t just start building a prototype — you won’t know what you should be prototyping and at what level of fidelity to get your question answered.</p>

                    <p>For example, when IDEO and Kodak were prototyping the first digital camera, their question was not about how people would take photos, or about how long the battery would last. It was about what the back-of-screen interaction might feel like. So, they made quick facsimile hardware that was much too large, just so they could test the back-of-screen interaction:</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
                            <a href="http://www.ideo.com/work/camera-interface-architecture" class="thumbnail">
                                <img class="img img-responsive" src="../images/p3-ideo-kodak.png">
                            </a>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Based on the questions, decide upon the best method of prototyping it. By now, you have a wide range of prototyping approaches in your arsenal. Prototypes can be hand-drawn, constructed physically, behavioral, or digital. Your skillset also includes Wizard of Oz prototypes, paper prototypes, video prototypes, and mocks. Which approach or toolkit will best represent each idea? The choice is yours here — and it need not be digital unless that is the best way to answer your question. (Reminder from CS 147: often, it's not.)</p>

                    <p>Capture your questions and prototypes so that we can understand what you did. Include relevant materials (e.g., images, videos) and a short description.</p>

                    <h4>Rapid feedback</h4>
                    <p>It's about time that we actually engaged with users, isn't it? Remember that testing many can produce better insights than testing one. So, bring your three prototypes to real people. Work with as many as you need to cover the feedback you need, typically somewhere around four users. If you have easy access to representative users for your designs, work with them. Otherwise, get as close as you can using the social capital you have at hand. Ask your studio staff if you need help.</p>

                    <p>Set the stage — the user's problem or goal — and remind the user that you are trying to test the prototypes, not the users. Take notes as they use each of your prototypes. When they are done, talk with them more holistically about the three prototypes. Find out what resonanted with each prototype relative to the others, and what missed the mark. While you will gather usability feedback, your primary goal is instead to gain insight into the broader design space and your general design ideas.</p>

                    <p>Write up a summary of your findings. First, describe your method and who you tested with. Second, tell us what you saw.</p>

                    <p>Third, tell us your interpretation and reflections. What did the feedback imply about your original design questions that led to the prototypes? Has this activity uncovered any deeper insight into the design space? Does it suggest any ideas for P4?</p>
