    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

<p class="lead"> P3 pulls it all together.  You will work in teams of
  3 people (from your studio) to combine your skills in design
  thinking, interaction design, and visual communication and solve a
  meaningful user need. You will iterate with the studio staff to
  refine your project's needs, ideas, studies, and prototypes. The
  project will culminate with an implemented prototype shown off to
  your adoring fans at the final project fair.</p>

                  <h2>Goal</h2>
		  Our theme for this quarter is Urban
		  Computing, and your goal in P3 is to develop a
		  project that uses computing to improve some aspect
		  of the urban environment, human life quality and/or
		  city operation systems. 

		  As you start this project we encourage you to
		  think broadly about the various groups of people
		  that interact in a city, the issues and problems
		  they encounter and how technology can make things
		  easier for them. Think about different aspects of
		  city life, such as government/governance,
		  commerce/business, safety, accessbility, and social
		  integration. As we discussed in class, this is a
		  broad theme and there are many different ways to
		  achieve the project goal.

                <div id="schedule" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Schedule and Feedback</h2>

                    <p>Your team can work on P3 at its own pace from here through the end of the quarter. There are 6 milestones along the way (see below) and a final project submission. You will receive completion points as you pass each milestone. You can continue to iterate and revise throughout the quarter, so your assessment will be delivered with your final submission at the end of the quarter. Between now and then, we will work with you in every studio to coach you toward the best project possible and give you feedback on each milestone.</p>

                    <p>As you proceed through the milestones, you can submit them via Dropbox before class and by bringing printouts to class to show in studio. You can turn in a milestone at any class studio meeting. As with prior assignments, if you have completed the milestone requirements, you will receive full points. When you submit each milestone, the course staff and your peers will work with you to critique your submission and provide a √-/√/√+ assessment.<p>

		      A √- typically means that you should go back and redo the milestone in more depth. A √ means that the milestone is sufficient to move on, but that we recommend a bit more thinking and iteration before you continue. A √+ means that you have exceeded our expectations. You are welcome to revise and resubmit a milestone as many times as you would like for feedback during studio sessions or office hours. Do so by updating the files in your Dropbox folder. We will accept revisions up until the final project deadline.</p>

                    <p>There are two reasons why we are using self-paced milestones for this final project. Primarily, in prior iterations of the class, students and instructors often wanted to go back and iterate on milestones before moving on, but a fixed deadline structure made this very difficult. Second, working together with a team to plan and execute a large-scale project over a period of weeks or months is central to design practice.</p>

                    <p>Below is our recommended timeline for Project 3. These dates are the dates by which we recommend completing each milestone: keep in mind that <b>it may take several iterations of feedback on submissions before you and your team are ready to declare a milestone complete</b>. So aim to submit your first version of each milestone at least one studio day before the deadline you want to hit. Remember that this schedule is a suggestion; we expect that some teams will take more time interating through some of these milestones and less time on others. </p>
