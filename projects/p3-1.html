    Assignment template
    ------------------
    To create a new assignment:
    1) Write all the HTML as you normally would underneath the #assignment-description div.
    2) Anything that you want to appear in the navbar on the left needs to be enclosed
        in a <div id="unique-id" class="sidenav-anchor">. On page load, hci.js will look up
        anything enclosed in .sidenav-anchor, find the first header (h1-h6) inside it, and add
        it to the navigation pane on the left. Make sure it has a unique div id so that there is something to anchor the hyperlink to.
    3) I recommend going with Bootstrap's recommendation and putting any <table class="table"> elements enclosed in a
        <div class="table-responsive">.

                        <p class="lead">P3 pulls it all together. You will combine your skills in design thinking, interaction design, and visual communication to solve a meaningful user need. You will iterate with the studio staff to refine your project's needs, ideas, studies, and prototypes. The project will culminate with an implemented prototype shown off to your adoring fans at the final project fair.</p>

                <div id="goals" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p>In P1, you practiced how to capture ideas and deepen your your needfinding insight. In P2, you demonstrated your visual and interaction design skills. Now, in P3, will synthesize these skills and combine them with prototyping tools toward an idea that you'll be creating as a functional prototype. This should be the most ambitious design project you've undertaken thus far.</p>

                    <p>Project 3 will be completed in groups of three from your studio. It consists of a multi-week, iterative design process to produce an implemented prototype in reaction to user needs on your studio's theme.</p>

                    <p>Part I focuses on forming a team, identifying a space of interest, and doing initial needfinding observation.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="schedule" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>P3 Schedule</h2>

                    <p>Your team can work at its own pace from here through the end of the quarter. There are many milestones along the way, and you will receive completion points as you pass each one. You can continue to iterate and revise throughout the quarter, so your assessment will be delivered with your final submission at the end of the quarter. Between now and then, we will work with you in every studio to coach you toward the best project possible and give you feedback on each milestone.</p>

                    <p>As you proceed through the milestones, you can submit them via Dropbox before class and by bringing printouts to class to show in studio. You can turn in a milestone at any class studio meeting. As with prior assignments, if you have completed the milestone requirements, you will receive full points. When you submit each milestone, the course staff and your peers will work with you to critique your submission and provide a √-/√/√+ assessment. A √- typically means that you should go back and redo the milestone in more depth. A √ means that the milestone is sufficient to move on, but that we recommend a bit more thinking and iteration before you continue. A √+ means that you have exceeded our expectations. You are welcome to revise and resubmit a milestone as many times as you would like for feedback during studio sessions or office hours. Do so by updating the files in your Dropbox folder. We will accept revisions up until the final project deadline.</p>

                    <p>There are two reasons why we are using self-paced milestones for this final project. Primarily, in prior iterations of the class, students and instructors often want to go back and iterate on milestones before moving on, but a fixed deadline structure makes this very difficult because the entire class has to stay in lock step. Second, we recognize that working together with a team to plan and execute a large-scale project over a period of weeks or months is central to design practice.</p>

                    <p>Below is the staff's recommended timeline for Project 3. These dates are the dates by which we recommend completing each milestone: keep in mind that <b>it may take several iterations of feedback on submissions before you and your team are ready to declare a milestone complete</b>. So aim to submit your first version of each milestone at least one studio day before the deadline you want to hit.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Oct. 19 (week 5): P3.I — form team, identify area of interest, and perform needfiding observation</li>
                        <li>Oct. 26 (week 6): P3.II — needfinding interpretation, brainstorming</li>

                        <li>November 19 (week 9): P3.IV — working implementation</li>
                        <li>November 30 (week 10): P3.V — user study results and redesign plan</li>
                        <li>December 4 (week 10): P3.VI — final presentation, <b>hard deadline</b></li>
                        <li>December 7 (finals) @ 12:15pm: Final submission, <b>hard deadline</b></li>

                <div id="team" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Form a team</h4>
                    <p>Form a team of three from your studio. We suggest that you seek out teammates who bring together complementary skills and who have compatible schedules and priorities. If your studio cannot divide evenly into groups of three, talk to the studio staff about options.</p>
                </div>

               <div id="plan" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Write a brief needfinding plan</h4>
                    <p>You are welcome to choose any direction that fits within your studio theme. You may take ideas from lecture, or brainstorm your own. The expectation will be that this round of needfinding in class will give you deeper insights into user needs than the last one, so it may take some time to set up the interviews and the trip. We'd also like to be able to give you feedback and connect you with relevant user groups when we can.</p>

                    <p>Decide on a rough needfinding plan, focusing on with whom and where you want to do your needfinding. Post a (private or public) note on Piazza describing your topic of interest and your needfinding plan, so we can give you feedback on the plan, before you go out to the field.</p>
                </div>                    

                <div id="observation" class="sidenav-anchor">
                    <h2>Observation</h4>
                    <p>Execute on your needfinding plan and gather your observations. Capture a mix of sketches, text, and when appropriate, photo and video.</p>

                    <p>Compile your team's observations together into one PDF. Now, filter your raw materials into five pages of your most interesting observations that the course staff can look at, and copy them into another PDF, alongside a couple sentences each of explanation if you'd like. Bring these selections to studio.</p>

                    <p>As part of your synthesis, generate three people profiles to capture different stakeholders or user groups. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hBcZuyHrgmr3cjRwsgiKO3rwcz2z-xv963EBkSaDp3w/edit?usp=sharing">(See a template here that you can copy and edit for your submission.)</a> People profiles ensure that you have enough depth on a perspective from your conversations to tell a story. They help your results become more emotionally resonant.</p>                    

                    <p>Next milestone will be to produce interpretations of these observations.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A text file with your team members' names and SUNet IDs.</li>

                    <p>Bring a full-page color printout of 1) your selected observations and 2) your people profiles with you to studio.</p>
